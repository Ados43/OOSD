# Work Product Completeness Checklist

**Purpose:** To verify that each section in your project deliverables contains all required and expected information before sign-off.

| # | Check Item | Description | Source Reference |
|---|------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Scope Coverage** | All relevant functions, features, constraints, and assumptions are documented. | IEEE 830 §3.2.1; PMBOK 5.2 |
| 2 | **Stakeholder Needs** | All identified stakeholders have their interests and expectations addressed. | ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 §5.2 |
| 3 | **Inputs & Outputs** | For each functional element, all valid and invalid inputs and expected outputs are documented. | Meyer, *Requirements Completeness*, Springer 2022 |
| 4 | **Performance & Constraints** | Non-functional attributes (performance, usability, security, portability) are explicitly stated. | ISO/IEC 25010 |
| 5 | **Context & Interfaces** | Operational environment, runtime requirements, and interfaces are described. | IEEE 1233 §5.3.4 |
| 6 | **Consistency & Clarity** | No contradictory statements; terms are defined and used consistently. | IEEE 830 §3.2.2 |
| 7 | **Verifiability** | All requirements are measurable or testable. | IEEE 830 §3.2.5 |
| 8 | **Traceability** | All items link backward to their source (stakeholder, regulation, change request) and forward to design/test artifacts. | IEEE 830 §3.2.6; Wikipedia *Requirements Traceability* |
| 9 | **Impact Assessment** | Any change requests or new requirements have documented effects on scope, schedule, cost, and quality. | PMBOK 4.6 |
| 10 | **Internal Completeness** | All concepts mentioned in the document are fully explained within the document or referenced. | IEEE definition, *The Elusive Definition of Requirements Completeness* |
| 11 | **Assumptions & Exceptions** | All assumptions, dependencies, and exception cases are documented. | IEEE 830 §3.2.3 |
| 12 | **Review & Approval** | Section has undergone peer/owner review with approval recorded. | PMBOK 5.5 |
